Write functions for working with shapes in standard
Planar coordinate system
</br>Points are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)
</br>Lines are represented by two points, marking their
beginning and ending
</br>L(P1(X1,Y1), P2(X2,Y2))
</br>Calculate the distance between two points
</br>Check if three segment lines can form a triangle
