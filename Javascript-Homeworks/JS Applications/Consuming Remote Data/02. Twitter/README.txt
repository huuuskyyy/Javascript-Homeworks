You must have Node JS installed.
Go to ..\Consuming Remote Data\02. Twitter\Twitter-NodeJSServer\Twitter-NodeJSServer and start the cmd console there
Run npm install, so any missing packages can be installed
Run node index.js command, so the server can be started
Then you can open the solution and run the html file
It will run only, if the server is started and if has all needed packages.
Make sure the cmd console is in the correct folder, when you execute Node commands!
