Implement a ComboBox control (like a dropdown list)
</br> The ComboBox holds a set of items (an array)
</br> Initially only a single item, the selected item, is visible
(the ComboBox is collapsed)
</br> When the selected item is clicked, all other items are
shown (the ComboBox is expanded)
</br> If an item is clicked, it becomes the selected item and the
ComboBox collapses
</br> Each of the items in a ComboBox can contain any valid
HTML code
</br> Use RequireJS and handlebars.js
</br> jQuery is not obligatory (use it if you will)
